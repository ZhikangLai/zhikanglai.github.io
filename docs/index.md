## **About Me**

I am an algorithm engineer and researcher with **six years of experience** designing data-driven and physics-based models that bridge applied mathematics and real-world engineering.  

I enjoy delving into complex problems through focused, deep thinking, and I find great satisfaction in every step of the iterative processâ€”from ideation and experimentation to implementation. **My research interests include (but are not limited to) machine learning, epidemic modelling, mechanical system identification, and path planning.** My long-term goal is to transform my knowledge and skills into practical, real-world engineering solutions. At the same time, I am excited to continue growing through interdisciplinary exploration and collaboration.

## <span style="color:#e67e22;">ðŸŽ“ **Academic Pursuit**</span> 

I am actively pursuing **â€‹PhD/MPhil opportunities**â€‹ to deepen my research capabilities in cutting-edge interdisciplinary applications, with particular focus on:

- **Nonlinear dynamics & machine learning**  
- **Large-scale data mining & statistical modelling**

I hope to join an open, inclusive research group that values collaboration and mutual learning.

## **Research & Professional Experience (2019 â€“ Present)**
- **COVID-19 Transmission Dynamics** â€” Studied COVID-19 transmission patterns using mathematical modeling to infer key transmission parameters and forecast outbreak trajectories across multiple countries.  

- **Tire Dynamics Modelling** â€” Conducted inverse parameter identification for complex mechanical systems to characterize tire behavior under varying load conditions.  

- **Electronic Component Lifetime Prediction** â€” Developed data-driven prognostic models to estimate the service life of travelling-wave tubes in high-power microwave systems.

- **Spatial Geometry & Path Planning** â€” Created a 3D spatial-geometry toolbox for UAV real-time monitoring, automating optimized waypoint generation and camera parameter calibration (focal length, yaw/pitch). Integrated pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra, 3D Jump Point Search) with TSP route optimization to compute globally optimal flight trajectories under constraints.

- **Solar Surface Irradiance** â€” Devised physics-based models to estimate ground-level solar radiation from localized sunshine-duration records.
